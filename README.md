I have created this app using the free version of replit.com
I have tested it within the replit interface alone.
It absolutely works within the replit interface.
I can not guarantee that the code will work in any other environment.
I am NOT a skilled programmer.
If anyone wants to explore this code you are free to do so.
It is intended fas a fun browser based game to learn the cipher.
